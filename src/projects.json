Behind this proxy server is a couple node.js applications that serve all the website content. The content is served and templated using express and handlebars, respectively. As the raspberry pi is sitting on my home network, a dynamic DNS needed to be setup. To achive this, I used the DDNS built into Google Domains, as that is where my domain was purchased. A script runs on the raspberry pi every hour to check if the IP address has changed and, if it did, it will update the Google DDNS server.",
